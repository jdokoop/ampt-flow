10/01/2008 v1.21/v2.21:
*  Changes made in the default AMPT model (version 1.21) 
   and the AMPT model with string melting (version 2.21):

	We have added an option to write out the complete parton information 
	right after string melting (before parton cascade). 
	Results are stored in ana/initial_parton_sm.dat in the same format 
	as ana/ampt.dat except for the first few lines that provide 
	information for each event. This option is only available for 
	string melting and can be activated by setting ioscar to 2.

	We have added an option to turn off phi meson decays at the end 
	of hadron cascade, i.e., at NT=NTMAX. 
	This option can be activated by setting iphidcy to 0.
	Note that phi decays during hadron cascade are always enabled.

   The above two modifications can be found by searching "clin-5b/2008". 
	
   Note: the following physics extensions are preliminary and under test, 
	therefore they have been disabled in v1.21/v2.21:
        We have included deuteron(d) production and destruction
        in the hadronic cascade via d+M <-> B+B, where M represents a meson 
	including pi, rho, omega and eta; and B represents a baryon 
	including proton, neutron, Delta, N*(1440) and N*(1535), 
        Anti-deuteron processes are included similarly. 
	Elastic collisions of d+M and d+B are also included. 
   The above modifications can be found by searching "clin-5/2008", 
	"clin-6/2008", "clin-8/2008" and "clin-9/2008".

04/29/2008 v1.13/v2.13:
*  Changes made in the default AMPT model (version 1.13) 
   and the AMPT model with string melting (version 2.13):

	multiple array arguments are checked against out-of-bound in amptsub.f;
	commented out the unused "CALL HJAN1A" in zpc.f;
	a pause statement in ran1() in zpc.f is modified;
	array sizes of ekaon() and sekaon() are increased from 200 to 2000;
	array sizes in /HJJET2/ and /xydr/ are increased from 900 to 150001;
	multiple compound IF statements are broken up in hipyset1.35.f;
	DARWIN added to the list of operating system in "exec";
	added a check on the range of IX, IY, IZ in art1f.f and modified 
		other such checks;
	added a check on the range of npion in art1f.f;
	RAN() renamed to RANART() to avoid conflict with system functions;
	bugs on initializations of xlast() and plast() are fixed;
	the variable ISS is modified to avoid out-of-bound error in EKAON();
       	"IF(K(I,3).EQ.0 .OR. K(K(I,3),2).EQ.IDSTR)" is modified 
		to avoid out-of-bound error in K();
	"DATA NSEED/74769375/" in hijing1.383_ampt.f is commented out;
	PYWIDT() subroutine is modified according to pythia-6115.f to avoid 
		undefined values for variables GGF,GZF,GZPF,ZZF,ZZPF,ZPZPF,API;
	"MDCY(KFPR(ISUB,1),1)" is changed to "MDCY(LUCOMP(KFPR(ISUB,1)),1)"
		to avoid invalid values for the 1st argument of MDCY();
	"if (jscat .ne. 0 .and. next(jscat) .ne. iscat)" is modified 
		to avoid out-of-bound error in next().

   The above modifications can be found by searching "clin-4/2008". 
   They are not found to change ampt.dat from a few tests on a Linux OS.
   We thanks A. Vander Molen and G. Westfall for pointing out these issues. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
2005 v1.12/v2.12:
*  Changes made in the default AMPT model (version 1.12) 
   and the AMPT model with string melting (version 2.12):

	Freezeout time of spectator projectile and target nucleons should be ~0
	 	but it was not correctly updated in 'ampt.dat'; now corrected.

   The above modifications can be found by searching "clin-12/14/03". 

   We have corrected a typo in `input.ampt':
	"IZT (target A number)" is changed to "IZT (target Z number)".

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
11/30/2004 v1.11/v2.11:
*  The default AMPT model (version 1.11) and the AMPT model with
   string melting (version 2.11) both use an initialization file 
   `input.ampt'. The analysis directory `ana/' contains the resulting
   data files. The final particle record file is `ana/ampt.dat'.
   The version number of AMPT is written to both the file `ana/version'
   and `nohup.out'.  The AMPT source code has been tested for both the
   f77 and the pgf77 compilers on the Unix, Linux, and OSF1 operating systems.

*  To run the AMPT program, one needs to:
   1. set the initial parameters in `input.ampt'. If one prefers to
      use run-time random number seed, set `ihjsed=11', In this way, every
      run is different even with the same `input.ampt' file.
   2. type `sh exec &' to compile and run the executable `ampt'
      with some general information written in `nohup.out'.

*  Key initial parameters in `input.ampt' are:
   EFRM: sqrt(s_NN) in GeV, e.g. 200 for the maximum RHIC energy.
   NEVNT: the total number of events.
   BMIN, BMAX: the minimum and maximum impact parameter (in fm) 
      for all events with BMAX having an upper limit of HIPR1(34)+HIPR1(35)
      (=19.87 fm for d+Au collisions and 25.60 fm for Au+Au collisions). 
   ISOFT: choice of parton-hadron conversion scenario.
      =1: default AMPT model (version 1.x);
      =4: the AMPT model with string melting (version 2.y).
         Note that values of 2, 3, and 5 have never been used for 
         publications. They are tests of other string melting scenarios:
         =2: a string is decomposed into q+dq+minijet partons instead of 
            using the Lund fragmentation;
         =3: a baryon is decomposed into q+qq instead of 3 quarks;
         =5: same as 4 but partons freeze out according to
            local energy density.
   NTMAX: the number of time-steps for hadron cascade, default(D)=150.
      Note that NTMAX=3 effectively turns off hadron cascade, 
      and a larger value than default is usually necessary 
      for observables at large rapidity or large pseudorapidity.
      We use NTMAX=1000 for HBT studies in central Au+Au
      collisions due to the need for the last interaction points 
      and for LHC calculations due to the longer lifetime of the formed matter.
   DT: value of the time-step (in fm/c) for hadron cascade, D=0.2.
      Note that t_cut=NTMAX*DT is the termination time of hadron cascade. 
   PARJ(41): parameter a in the Lund symmetric splitting function. 
   PARJ(42): parameter b in the Lund symmetric splitting function 
      (in GeV**(-2)). Note that we use default value in HIJING 
      (a=0.5 and b=0.9) for d+Au collisions, 
      and a=2.2 and b=0.5 for collisions of heavy nuclei.
   flag for popcorn mechanism: D=1(Yes) turns on the popcorn mechanism. 
      In general, it increases baryon stopping.
   PARJ(5): controls BMBbar vs. BBbar in the popcorn mechanism, D=1.0. 
   shadowing flag: D=1(Yes) turns on nuclear shadowing. 
   quenching flag: D=0(No) turns off jet quenching 
      since the parton cascade ZPC simulates final-state effects. 
   p0 cutoff: D=2.0 (in GeV/c) for p0 in HIJING for minijet production. 
   parton screening mass: controls the parton cross section, 
      D=3.2264 (in fm**(-1)). Its square is inversely proportional to 
      the parton cross section. Use D=3.2264d0 for 3mb, and 2.2814d0 for 6mb.
   ihjsed: choice of the random number seed, D=0.
      =0: take the `Ran Seed for HIJING' in `input.ampt'
         and disregard the random value generated in the file `exec'.
      =11: take the HIJING random seed at runtime from the file `exec', 
         with the seed written in `nohup.out' and `ana/version'.
   Ran Seed for HIJING: random number seed for HIJING when ihjsed=0.
   Kshort decay flag: depends on the experimental correction procedure, 
      D=0 turns off Kshort decays after the hadron cascade.
      Note that decays of the following resonances and their
      antiparticles are always included: 
      rho, omega, eta, K*, phi, Delta, N*(1440), N*(1535),
      Sigma0 (in order to include its feed down to Lambda). 
   optional OSCAR output: if set to 1, outputs in OSCAR1997A format
      are written in `ana/parton.oscar' and `ana/hadron.oscar'. 
   dpcoal: parton coalescence distance in momentum space (in GeV/c).
   drcoal: parton coalescence distance in coordinate space (in fm).
      dpcoal, drcoal both have D=10**6 for nearest-neighbor coalescence 
      in the AMPT model with string melting. 

*  Key output file are:
   ana/ampt.dat: It contains particle records at hadron kinetic freeze-out, 
      i.e., at the last interaction point. 
      For each event, the first line gives: 
         event number, test number(=1), number of particles in the event, 
         impact parameter, total number of participant nucleons in projectile,
         total number of participant nucleons in target, number of participant 
         nucleons in projectile due to elastic collisions, number of 
         participant nucleons in projectile due to inelastic collisions, 
         and corresponding numbers in target. 
         Note that participant nucleon numbers include nucleons participating 
         in both elastic and inelastic collisions.
      Each of the following lines gives: 
         PYTHIA particle ID number, three-momentum(Px,Py,Pz), mass, and 
         space-time coordinates(x,y,z,t) of one final particle at freeze-out.

   ana/zpc.dat:    similar to `ana/ampt.dat' but for partons at freeze-out.
      The first line of each event gives:
         event number, number of partons in the event, impact-parameter, 
         number of participant nucleons in projectile due to elastic 
         collisions, number of participant nucleons in projectile due to 
         inelastic collisions, and corresponding numbers in target. 
      Each of the following lines gives:
          PYTHIA particle ID number, three-momentum(Px,Py,Pz), mass, and 
          space-time coordinates(x,y,z,t) of one final parton at freeze-out.

   Note that momenta are in units of GeV/c, mass in GeV/c**2, 
      space in fm, and time in fm/c. 
      If a particle comes from the decay of a resonance which still exists 
      at the termination time of hadron cascade, then its space-time 
      corresponds to the decay point of the parent resonance.
      Also note that the x-axis in AMPT is defined as the direction along 
      the impact parameter, and the z-axis is defined as the beam direction.
